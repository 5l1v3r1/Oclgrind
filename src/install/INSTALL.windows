To install Oclgrind, run 'install.bat' as an Administrator. This will
install Oclgrind to 'C:\Program Files\Oclgrind' and create a registry
entry for the OpenCL ICD loader. Oclgrind can be uninstalled by
running 'uninstall.bat' as an Administrator.

Alternatively, Oclgrind can be run from any other directory. You will
need to manually create OpenCL ICD loading points by editing the
registry (see oclgrind-icd.reg).
